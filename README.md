## Background
Using devices such as JawboneUp, NikeFuelBand, and Fitbit, it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behaviour, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.

In this project, the goal is to use data from `accelerometers` on the `belt`, `forearm`, `arm`, and `dumbell` of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the [website](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har) (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

## Approach
We first tried `classification tree` which give around 50% accuracy. After we used `Random Forest` approach, that give us 99% accuracy.
